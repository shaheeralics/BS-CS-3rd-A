Certainly! Let's start by defining queues and priority queues, then we'll discuss basic operations and provide examples. Finally, I'll provide a simple C++ program implementing a queue.

### Definition of Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). It represents a collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (deletion).

### Definition of Priority Queue:
A priority queue is a variation of a queue where each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority. In a priority queue, elements are enqueued with their priority, and the element with the highest priority is dequeued first.

### Basic Operations on Queue:
1. Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. Front: Returns the element at the front without removing it.
4. IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

### Implementation of Queue (Example in C++):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Example of a basic queue
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Enqueue elements
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Dequeue and display elements
    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << myQueue.front() << " ";  // Display front element
        myQueue.pop();  // Dequeue front element
    }

    std::cout << "\n";

    // Example of a priority queue
    std::priority_queue<int> myPriorityQueue;

    // Enqueue elements with priority
    myPriorityQueue.push(30);
    myPriorityQueue.push(10);
    myPriorityQueue.push(20);

    // Dequeue and display elements
    while (!myPriorityQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << myPriorityQueue.top() << " ";  // Display highest priority element
        myPriorityQueue.pop();  // Dequeue highest priority element
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This simple C++ program demonstrates the use of both a basic queue and a priority queue. It enqueues elements, dequeues them, and prints the results. You can modify and expand this program based on your specific needs.

**Divide and Conquer:**
Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving strategy where a problem is divided into subproblems that are solved independently, and then their solutions are combined to solve the original problem. This approach is often used in algorithm design and optimization.

**Implementation of Divide and Conquer in Merge Sort:**
Merge Sort is a classic example of the divide and conquer strategy. It involves dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Here is a basic explanation and example of the Merge Sort algorithm:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

// Merge two sorted halves into a single sorted array
void merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    std::vector<int> leftArr(n1);
    std::vector<int> rightArr(n2);

    // Copy data to temporary arrays leftArr[] and rightArr[]
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)
        rightArr[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];

    // Merge the temporary arrays back into arr[left..right]
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
            arr[k] = leftArr[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            arr[k] = rightArr[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }

    // Copy the remaining elements of leftArr[], if there are any
    while (i < n1) {
        arr[k] = leftArr[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }

    // Copy the remaining elements of rightArr[], if there are any
    while (j < n2) {
        arr[k] = rightArr[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}

// Recursive function to perform merge sort on the array
void mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        // Same as (left+right)/2, but avoids overflow for large left and right
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Sort first and second halves
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

        // Merge the sorted halves
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<int> arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};

    std::cout << "Original array: ";
    for (int num : arr)
        std::cout << num << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    mergeSort(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);

    std::cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int num : arr)
        std::cout << num << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `mergeSort` is the recursive function implementing the divide and conquer strategy, and `merge` is the function responsible for merging two sorted halves.

The program initializes an array, prints the original array, performs the merge sort, and then prints the sorted array.

Sure, let's go through each of the concepts you mentioned and provide programming examples in C++.

### 1. Recursion:
Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. It breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem.

### 2. Factorial using Recursion:
Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

// Function to calculate factorial using recursion
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
    std::cin >> num;

    if (num < 0) {
        std::cout << "Please enter a non-negative integer." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is: " << factorial(num) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Power using Recursion:
Calculate the power of a number.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

// Function to calculate power using recursion
int power(int base, int exponent) {
    if (exponent == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int base, exponent;
    std::cout << "Enter base: ";
    std::cin >> base;
    std::cout << "Enter exponent: ";
    std::cin >> exponent;

    std::cout << base << " raised to the power " << exponent << " is: " << power(base, exponent) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### 4. GCD using Recursion:
Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

// Function to calculate GCD using recursion
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    std::cout << "Enter two integers: ";
    std::cin >> num1 >> num2;

    std::cout << "GCD of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is: " << gcd(num1, num2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Fibonacci using Recursion:
Generate the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

// Function to calculate Fibonacci using recursion
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter the term number in the Fibonacci sequence: ";
    std::cin >> num;

    std::cout << "The " << num << "th term in the Fibonacci sequence is: " << fibonacci(num) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each program begins with necessary header files and includes the `iostream` header for input/output operations.
- The main functionality is implemented in functions (`factorial`, `power`, `gcd`, `fibonacci`) using recursion.
- In the `main` function, user input is taken, and the corresponding recursive function is called.
- The programs are designed to handle non-negative integers and provide meaningful output.

Make sure to compile and run these programs in a C++ environment to see the results. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about the code or recursion!

**Hashing and Hash Functions:**

Hashing is a process of converting input data (or a 'key') into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. This code is generated by a hash function. The purpose of hashing is to quickly locate a data record given its search key. Hash functions are designed to be fast and efficient.

**Hashing Method:**

The most common hashing method is the division method. In this method, the key is divided by a prime number, and the remainder is used as the index for storing the data in a hash table.

**Collision Resolution:**

Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. There are various methods to handle collisions, and one common method is chaining. In chaining, each hash table entry is a linked list, and collisions are resolved by adding elements to the list at the corresponding index.

Here's a simple example in C++ that demonstrates hashing, hash functions, and collision resolution using chaining:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;

class HashTable {
private:
    std::list<int> table[TABLE_SIZE];

public:
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(key);
    }

    void displayTable() {
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; ++i) {
            std::cout << "Index " << i << ": ";
            for (auto it = table[i].begin(); it != table[i].end(); ++it) {
                std::cout << *it << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable hashTable;

    // Inserting elements into the hash table
    hashTable.insert(5);
    hashTable.insert(15);
    hashTable.insert(25);
    hashTable.insert(6);
    hashTable.insert(16);

    // Displaying the hash table
    hashTable.displayTable();

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. `hashFunction(int key)`: This function implements the division method to generate the hash code.

2. `insert(int key)`: This function inserts the key into the hash table using the hash code obtained from the hash function. It uses chaining to handle collisions.

3. `displayTable()`: This function displays the contents of the hash table, showing the index and the elements stored at that index.

In the example, keys 5, 15, 25, 6, and 16 are inserted into the hash table. The `displayTable()` function then shows how the elements are distributed across the hash table.

This is a basic illustration, and in a real-world scenario, hash functions and collision resolution methods might be more sophisticated depending on the application.

Sure, let's go through the concepts of Trees, Binary Trees, and some basic operations on trees, and then I'll provide a simple example and its implementation in C++.

### Trees:
A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and every node in the tree has zero or more child nodes. Nodes with no children are called leaves.

### Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a specific type of tree in which each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Operations on Trees:
1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all nodes of the tree in a specific order.

Now, let's create a simple program in C++ that represents a binary tree, inserts nodes, and performs an in-order traversal.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a structure for a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node in the binary tree
TreeNode* insertNode(TreeNode* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(value);
    }

    if (value < root->data) {
        root->left = insertNode(root->left, value);
    } else {
        root->right = insertNode(root->right, value);
    }

    return root;
}

// Function for in-order traversal of the binary tree
void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inOrderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->data << " ";
        inOrderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty binary tree
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert nodes into the binary tree
    root = insertNode(root, 10);
    root = insertNode(root, 5);
    root = insertNode(root, 15);
    root = insertNode(root, 3);
    root = insertNode(root, 7);

    // Perform in-order traversal and display the nodes
    cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. The program starts by defining a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the binary tree.
2. The `insertNode` function is used to insert a new node into the binary tree while maintaining the binary search tree property.
3. The `inOrderTraversal` function performs an in-order traversal of the tree, printing the values of the nodes in sorted order.
4. In the `main` function, a binary tree is created, and nodes are inserted. Finally, the in-order traversal is performed and displayed.

When you run this program, it should output:
```
In-order traversal: 3 5 7 10 15
```

This is just a basic example, and there are many other operations and variations you can implement depending on your specific requirements.

Certainly! Let's discuss storage and retrieval properties along with techniques for various data structures. I'll provide examples for each data structure and a simple program in C++ for one of them. Let's focus on the basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, and Hash Tables.

### 1. Arrays:
**Storage Property:** Contiguous memory allocation, O(1) random access.
**Retrieval Technique:** Directly accessing elements using index.

**Example: C++ Program for Array:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declaration and Initialization of an Array
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Retrieval: Accessing elements using index
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Element at index " << i << ": " << arr[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:** This program declares an array of integers, initializes it, and then iterates through the array using a loop to print each element with its index.

### 2. Linked Lists:
**Storage Property:** Dynamic memory allocation, non-contiguous.
**Retrieval Technique:** Traversing the list sequentially.

**Example: C++ Program for Linked List:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

int main() {
    // Creating a Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    head->next = new Node(2);
    head->next->next = new Node(3);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new Node(5);

    // Retrieval: Traversing the Linked List
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Node data: " << current->data << std::endl;
        current = current->next;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:** This program creates a simple linked list with nodes containing integers. It then traverses the linked list using a while loop and prints the data in each node.

### 3. Hash Tables:
**Storage Property:** Uses a hash function to map keys to indices.
**Retrieval Technique:** Direct access through key hashing.

**Example: C++ Program for Hash Table:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    // Creating a Hash Table
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> hashTable;

    // Inserting data into the Hash Table
    hashTable["one"] = 1;
    hashTable["two"] = 2;
    hashTable["three"] = 3;
    hashTable["four"] = 4;
    hashTable["five"] = 5;

    // Retrieval: Direct access through key hashing
    std::cout << "Value for key 'three': " << hashTable["three"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:** This program uses the `std::unordered_map` from the C++ standard library to implement a hash table. It inserts key-value pairs and then retrieves the value associated with the key "three".

These are simple examples to illustrate storage and retrieval properties for these data structures. Real-world implementations may involve more complexity and considerations.

### Polynomial & Intractable Algorithms:

#### Polynomial Algorithms:

Polynomial algorithms are algorithms whose worst-case time complexity is a polynomial function of the input size. These algorithms are generally considered efficient and feasible for practical use.

Example: **Bubble Sort Algorithm**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& array) {
    int n = array.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; ++j) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                // Swap elements if they are in the wrong order
                std::swap(array[j], array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> exampleArray = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    
    std::cout << "Original Array: ";
    for (int num : exampleArray) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    bubbleSort(exampleArray);

    std::cout << "\nSorted Array: ";
    for (int num : exampleArray) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.
- The `bubbleSort` function sorts the input array in ascending order.
- The main function initializes an array, prints the original array, performs sorting using the bubbleSort function, and then prints the sorted array.

#### Intractable Algorithms:

Intractable algorithms, often referred to as "NP-Hard" or "NP-Complete," have exponential time complexity. Solving instances of these problems becomes increasingly difficult as the input size grows.

Example: **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int tsp(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& graph, int start) {
    std::vector<int> cities(graph.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); ++i) {
        if (i != start) {
            cities[i] = i;
        }
    }

    int minPath = INT_MAX;
    do {
        int currentPath = 0;
        int k = start;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.size() - 1; ++i) {
            currentPath += graph[k][cities[i]];
            k = cities[i];
        }
        currentPath += graph[k][start];

        minPath = std::min(minPath, currentPath);

    } while (std::next_permutation(cities.begin(), cities.end()));

    return minPath;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> exampleGraph = {
        {0, 10, 15, 20},
        {10, 0, 35, 25},
        {15, 35, 0, 30},
        {20, 25, 30, 0}
    };

    int startCity = 0;
    int minPath = tsp(exampleGraph, startCity);

    std::cout << "Minimum Traveling Distance: " << minPath << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This program demonstrates the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), an NP-hard problem, where the goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once.
- The `tsp` function takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and a starting city, then finds the minimum traveling distance using a brute-force approach.
- The main function initializes a graph and finds the minimum traveling distance starting from a specified city.

In summary, the first example illustrates a polynomial algorithm (Bubble Sort), while the second example illustrates an intractable algorithm (TSP). The TSP example uses a brute-force approach, which is inefficient for large input sizes, highlighting the intractable nature of the problem.

Sure, I'll provide a brief explanation of graph representation, terminologies, adjacency matrix, operations on graphs, and then provide a simple example with a C++ program to illustrate these concepts.

### Graph Representation & Terminologies:

A graph G is a pair (V, E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting the vertices.

**Terminologies:**
1. **Vertex (Node):** A fundamental unit in a graph.
2. **Edge (Link):** Connects two vertices to represent a relationship between them.
3. **Degree of a Vertex:** The number of edges incident on a vertex.
4. **Path:** A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
5. **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
6. **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction.
7. **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction.
8. **Weighted Graph:** Each edge has an associated weight.

### Adjacency Matrix:

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where each cell at (i, j) represents whether there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.

### Operations on Graph:

1. **Add Vertex:** Adds a new vertex to the graph.
2. **Add Edge:** Adds an edge between two vertices.
3. **Remove Vertex:** Removes a vertex and all its incident edges.
4. **Remove Edge:** Removes an edge between two vertices.
5. **Traversal:** Visiting all the vertices of the graph.

### Example and C++ Program:

Let's consider a simple undirected graph with three vertices: A, B, and C. The edges are (A, B) and (B, C).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
private:
    int V; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adjMatrix;

public:
    Graph(int vertices) : V(vertices) {
        // Initialize the adjacency matrix with zeros
        adjMatrix.resize(V, vector<int>(V, 0));
    }

    void addEdge(int from, int to) {
        // For an undirected graph, set both cells to 1
        adjMatrix[from][to] = 1;
        adjMatrix[to][from] = 1;
    }

    void printGraph() {
        cout << "Adjacency Matrix:" << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < V; ++j) {
                cout << adjMatrix[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a graph with 3 vertices
    Graph graph(3);

    // Add edges to the graph
    graph.addEdge(0, 1); // Edge between A and B
    graph.addEdge(1, 2); // Edge between B and C

    // Print the graph
    graph.printGraph();

    return 0;
}
```

### Program Explanation:

1. **Class `Graph`:** Represents a graph with an adjacency matrix.
2. **Constructor:** Initializes the number of vertices and the adjacency matrix.
3. **`addEdge` Function:** Adds an undirected edge between two vertices.
4. **`printGraph` Function:** Prints the adjacency matrix.
5. **`main` Function:** Creates a graph, adds edges, and prints the adjacency matrix.

In this example, the program creates a graph with three vertices (0, 1, and 2) and adds edges between them. The resulting adjacency matrix is printed to the console.

Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about the program or any other graph-related concepts!

Sure, I'll provide an example of the Kruskal's algorithm using a greedy approach along with a C++ program. Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a connected, undirected graph. The greedy approach involves sorting the edges by their weights and adding them to the MST in ascending order until all vertices are included.

Here's the C++ program for Kruskal's algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent an edge
struct Edge {
    int src, dest, weight;
};

// Structure to represent a subset for union-find
struct Subset {
    int parent, rank;
};

class Graph {
public:
    vector<Edge> edges;
    int vertices;

    Graph(int vertices);
    void addEdge(int src, int dest, int weight);
    int kruskalMST();
};

Graph::Graph(int vertices) {
    this->vertices = vertices;
}

void Graph::addEdge(int src, int dest, int weight) {
    Edge edge = {src, dest, weight};
    edges.push_back(edge);
}

// Function to find the set of an element i
int find(Subset subsets[], int i) {
    if (subsets[i].parent != i)
        subsets[i].parent = find(subsets, subsets[i].parent);

    return subsets[i].parent;
}

// Function that does union of two sets of x and y
void Union(Subset subsets[], int x, int y) {
    int xroot = find(subsets, x);
    int yroot = find(subsets, y);

    if (subsets[xroot].rank < subsets[yroot].rank)
        subsets[xroot].parent = yroot;
    else if (subsets[xroot].rank > subsets[yroot].rank)
        subsets[yroot].parent = xroot;
    else {
        subsets[yroot].parent = xroot;
        subsets[xroot].rank++;
    }
}

int Graph::kruskalMST() {
    vector<Edge> result;

    // Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const Edge& a, const Edge& b) {
        return a.weight < b.weight;
    });

    Subset* subsets = new Subset[vertices];

    // Create V subsets with single elements
    for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
        subsets[v].parent = v;
        subsets[v].rank = 0;
    }

    // Number of edges to be taken is equal to V-1
    int edgesTaken = 0;
    int i = 0;  // Index used to pick next edge

    while (edgesTaken < vertices - 1 && i < edges.size()) {
        Edge next_edge = edges[i++];
        int x = find(subsets, next_edge.src);
        int y = find(subsets, next_edge.dest);

        // If including this edge doesn't cause cycle, include it in the result and increment the index
        if (x != y) {
            result.push_back(next_edge);
            Union(subsets, x, y);
            edgesTaken++;
        }
    }

    // Display the result
    cout << "Edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree:\n";
    for (const Edge& edge : result) {
        cout << edge.src << " - " << edge.dest << " : " << edge.weight << endl;
    }

    delete[] subsets;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Graph g(4);
    g.addEdge(0, 1, 10);
    g.addEdge(0, 2, 6);
    g.addEdge(0, 3, 5);
    g.addEdge(1, 3, 15);
    g.addEdge(2, 3, 4);

    g.kruskalMST();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Edge and Subset structures:** These structures are used to represent graph edges and subsets for the union-find algorithm, respectively.

2. **Graph class:** This class represents the graph and contains methods for adding edges and finding the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.

3. **find() and Union() functions:** These functions are part of the union-find algorithm, used to detect cycles in the graph.

4. **kruskalMST() function:** This function implements Kruskal's algorithm using a greedy approach. It sorts the edges by weight, then iterates through them, adding edges to the minimum spanning tree if they don't form a cycle.

5. **main() function:** This function demonstrates the usage of the Graph class by creating a graph with four vertices and adding edges to it. Finally, it calls the kruskalMST() function to find and print the minimum spanning tree.

Note: Make sure to understand the logic of Kruskal's algorithm, union-find, and the overall structure of the program for a better understanding.

Certainly! Below is a simple C++ program that implements a binary tree using linked list representation. It also inserts nodes into the binary tree of characters and demonstrates all three traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    char data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    // Constructor
    TreeNode(char value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform inorder traversal of a binary tree
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->data << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Function to perform preorder traversal of a binary tree
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        cout << root->data << " ";
        preorderTraversal(root->left);
        preorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Function to perform postorder traversal of a binary tree
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        postorderTraversal(root->left);
        postorderTraversal(root->right);
        cout << root->data << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode('A');
    root->left = new TreeNode('B');
    root->right = new TreeNode('C');
    root->left->left = new TreeNode('D');
    root->left->right = new TreeNode('E');
    root->right->left = new TreeNode('F');
    root->right->right = new TreeNode('G');

    // Displaying the tree using inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
    cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Deallocating memory (freeing up the dynamically allocated nodes)
    // This step is important to prevent memory leaks
    // You may want to implement a more sophisticated memory management system
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `TreeNode` structure represents a node in the binary tree, with data, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.

2. Three functions (`inorderTraversal`, `preorderTraversal`, and `postorderTraversal`) are defined to perform the corresponding tree traversals recursively.

3. In the `main` function, a sample binary tree is created, and the three traversals are demonstrated.

4. Finally, memory allocated for the nodes is deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

Note: In a real-world scenario, you might want to implement more robust memory management and error handling mechanisms.

Sure, let's go step by step.

### Q. No. 1: Draw BST from the given Data:

The given data is: 14, 15, 4, 9, 7, 18, 3, 5, 16, 4, 20, 17, 9, 14, 5

Drawing the Binary Search Tree (BST):

```
            14
           /  \
          4    15
         / \     \
        3   9     18
           / \   /  \
          7  14 16   20
             / \
            5   9
               /
              17
```

### Q. No. 2: Write C++ code for inOrder traversal on the above given BST:

Here's the C++ code for inOrder traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a TreeNode
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    // Constructor
    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform inOrder traversal on a BST
void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    // Traverse the left subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Process the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Traverse the right subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Constructing the BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(14);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(9);
    root->left->right->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(14);
    root->left->right->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->right->right->left = new TreeNode(9);

    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(16);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->right->right->left->right = new TreeNode(17);

    // Performing inOrder traversal
    std::cout << "InOrder Traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);

    // Memory cleanup (freeing dynamically allocated memory)
    // This is usually done in a more comprehensive manner in real-world applications
    delete root->right->right->left->right;
    delete root->right->right->left;
    delete root->right->right->right;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left->right->left->right;
    delete root->left->right->left;
    delete root->left->right->right->left;
    delete root->left->right->right;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Program:

1. **TreeNode Structure:** Represents a node in the BST, with integer data, left, and right pointers.

2. **inOrderTraversal Function:** Recursively traverses the BST in inOrder (left-root-right) and prints the data of each node.

3. **Main Function:** 
   - Constructs the given BST.
   - Calls `inOrderTraversal` to perform inOrder traversal.
   - Performs memory cleanup to free dynamically allocated memory.

### Diagram of the Tree:

The diagram is already provided above in the BST drawing. If you have any specific questions about the code or the tree structure, feel free to ask!

Sure, I can help you with that. Let's start with the C++ code for a Binary Search Tree (BST) using string data and then display the sorted data in ascending order. Here's the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Node class for BST
class Node {
public:
    string data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(string value) {
        data = value;
        left = right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Binary Search Tree class
class BST {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function to insert a node into the BST
    Node* insert(Node* node, string value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new Node(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insert(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insert(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Helper function to perform in-order traversal and display sorted data
    void inOrderTraversal(Node* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inOrderTraversal(node->left);
            cout << node->data << endl;
            inOrderTraversal(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Public function to insert a value into the BST
    void insert(string value) {
        root = insert(root, value);
    }

    // Public function to display sorted data
    void displaySortedData() {
        inOrderTraversal(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Given Data
    string data[] = {"babble", "fable", "jacket", "backup", "eagle", "daily", "gain", "bandit",
                     "abandon", "abash", "accuse", "economy", "adhere", "advise", "cease",
                     "debunk", "feeder", "genius", "fetch", "chain", NULL};

    // Create BST and insert data
    BST bst;
    for (int i = 0; data[i] != NULL; ++i) {
        bst.insert(data[i]);
    }

    // Display sorted data
    cout << "Sorted Data:" << endl;
    bst.displaySortedData();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. The program defines a `Node` class to represent nodes in the BST, and a `BST` class to represent the binary search tree.
2. The `insert` function is a recursive helper function to insert a new node into the BST.
3. The `inOrderTraversal` function performs an in-order traversal of the tree, printing the data in sorted order.
4. In the `main` function, an array of strings is given as input data.
5. An instance of the `BST` class is created, and each string from the input array is inserted into the BST.
6. Finally, the sorted data is displayed using the `displaySortedData` function.

As for drawing a diagram of the tree, it's best visualized using a graphical tool or by hand. Each node represents a string, and the left child is smaller, while the right child is larger. For the given example, the tree would look like this:

```
                            abandon
                           / 
                       abash
                      / 
                   accuse
                  /       \
               adhere    babble
                        /       \
                    backup    bandit
                               /     \
                             cease   chain
                            /
                         daily
                          \
                          debunk
                             \
                            eagle
                             / \
                        economy fetch
                                  /   \
                               feeder  genius
```

Creating a diagram in text can be a bit challenging, but I can provide a simple representation of the hash table structure with key-value pairs. Keep in mind that this is a textual representation and may not be as visually clear as a graphical diagram.

Let's consider a hash table with a size of 10:

```
Index:  0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
       |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
```

Now, let's insert some key-value pairs:

1. Insert("John", 25):

```
Index:  0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
       |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
                               |                    |
                               |                    +--> ("John", 25)
                               |
```

2. Insert("Alice", 30):

```
Index:  0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
       |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
                               |                    |
                               |                    +--> ("John", 25)
                               |
                               +--> ("Alice", 30)
```

3. Insert("Bob", 22):

```
Index:  0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8         9
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
       |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
                               |                    |
                               |                    +--> ("John", 25)
                               |
                   +--> ("Bob", 22)
                   |
                   +--> ("Alice", 30)
```

This is a basic textual representation of how the key-value pairs might be stored in the hash table. The actual implementation would involve handling collisions, dynamic resizing, and other considerations for a robust hash table.
