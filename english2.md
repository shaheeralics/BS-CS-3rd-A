The Transactional model, on the other hand, emphasizes the dynamic and interactive nature of communication, where both sender and receiver play active roles in encoding and decoding messages simultaneously.

*Example 2: Types of Communication*
Interpersonal communication occurs between individuals, fostering personal connections and relationships. Intrapersonal communication involves self-talk and internal dialogue. Small group communication, evident in team collaborations, requires effective coordination and shared understanding. Mass communication, through media channels, reaches a large audience but may lack immediate feedback.

By the end of Week 2, students gain a comprehensive understanding of the foundational elements that constitute communication. This knowledge forms the basis for further exploration of communication barriers, behaviors, and strategies in the upcoming weeks.

*Example 2: Transactional Analysis*
Transactional analysis helps individuals analyze and understand their communication patterns. For instance, recognizing when one is operating from a "parent" ego state, characterized by authority and judgment, can lead to more mindful and effective communication. The goal is to promote interactions from the "adult" state, characterized by rationality and objectivity.

By the end of Week 3, students should be able to identify and analyze various communication barriers and behaviors.

*Example 1: Nonverbal Cues in Job Interviews*
In a job interview, nonverbal cues play a crucial role. Maintaining eye contact conveys confidence, while a firm handshake indicates professionalism. Conversely, fidgeting or avoiding eye contact may create an impression of nervousness or lack of sincerity. Understanding and harnessing these nonverbal elements can significantly impact the interviewee's success.

*Example 2: Paralanguage in Public Speaking*
Public speakers use paralanguage to enhance their message. A speaker who modulates their voice effectively, using pauses for emphasis and varying pitch for engagement, can capture the audience's attention. Conversely, a monotonous delivery may lead to disinterest. Paralanguage is a powerful tool in conveying emotions and maintaining audience engagement.
